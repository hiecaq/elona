This repo shows how I run Elona under Wine, in Guix.

* Preparation
Download Elona from its [[https://ylvania.org/elona_e.html][official website]], and unpack it under a sub-directory named =elona= in this root directory. Patch it as needed.

* Environment
Use =./env= to enter the Guix Shell.

* Run
When in the Guix Shell environment, use one of the =run(_zh|_jp)?.sh= to start the game. Enjoy!

* What to do if the window is too small?
Full screen does not work on my site, even with Wine configured under virtual desktop mode. However, we can change the X11 resolution instead, for example:
#+begin_src sh
  xrandr --output DisplayPort-0 --mode 1920x1080
#+end_src
